I have always loved the true story of this event since I first learned of it. This version is one of the most beautiful versions, taking poetic license, but still capturing the sense of what happened during that sad time yet wonderful day. Love this, so worthwhile for a holiday or anytime film. This is one that my family has added to each year as part of our holiday treasure films.
