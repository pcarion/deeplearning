The movie depicts a factual event of WWI but it is a bit drawn out and, frankly, boring at times. It is also hard to watch as it is a foreign film in various languages with subtitles. It is somewhat disjointed at the beginning, but eventually ties together. It is not clear that the two ficticious opera singers are married, which is important because if they are not married they have a torrid love affair, which they really didn't have. But that doesn't matter because they never existed in the first place. Also, the scene where the French soldier dressed in a German uniform is shot by the Scots never happened but it is there for dramatic effect, one presumes. The movie would have been better if they had stayed with the facts. If you want to see this remarkable event properly you should buy the History Channel movie of it which contains original footage and interviews with some of the participants - all dead now of course, but they got their stories on film. Joyeux Noel is a movie that didn't need to be made, or if it was going to be, it should have been made better.
