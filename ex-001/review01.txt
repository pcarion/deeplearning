The assassination of the Heir to the Austro-Hungarian Throne on 28 June 1914 by the murderous hands of a Serbian nationalist, motivated by selfishly inclined Serbian officers, ignited the until then unimaginable brutality of a worldwide war on an industrial basis with machine guns, tanks, air crafts and a variety of poisonous gasses. More then 17 million promising lives were extinguished during World War I, 1 August 1914-11 November 1918. In World War II, basically the continuation of World War I, another 60 million were killed. Still over all the years, from 1914-1945, the flicker of enlightened human decency spontaneously sparked by Christian, humane-thinking, feeling and believing front line soldiers of England, France and Germany would never vanish from the hearts and minds of those who experienced the grand horror of trench warfare as endured in North Eastern France and the mass casualties of fast, unrelenting mechanized warfare suffered later on all over Europe and North Africa. What the three company commanders, all lieutenants, achieved in safeguarding the Christmas Eve truth of 1914 could not be realized in the Treaty of Versailles and the newly formed League of Nations engineered by the involved belligerent nations. Only after World War II, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) emerged, which also took Germany into its fold. The European Union, now incorporating 28 nations, makes commerce and finance their unified concern, while NATO assures the peace among Europeans and nations beyond. In the end, the lieutenants prevailed! Artistically, "Joyeux Noel" deeply touches its viewers' hearts and souls. So does its accompanying music. Needless to say, all actors involved gave a truly magnificent performance, with Diane Krueger on top.
